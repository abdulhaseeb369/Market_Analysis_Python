- [ ]  Co-relation Analysis
    - Everyday based on the movement of DOW, NASDAQ, Crude oil, etc movement, we need to predict the movement of the market
    - We can take co-relation analysis of 5Y, 15Y and 30 years and come up with data points based on co-relation. (may be average of all 3 and then relate, may be 3 different relative points, etc)
- [ ]  Options OI analysis to get Support and resistance levels.
    - Highest OI levels are usually considered for support and resistance
    - Need to calculate PCR on the basis of highest 3 PE and CE levels
- [ ]  Support and resistance levels based on VIX.
    - Need to search how it actually works. There is a formula.
